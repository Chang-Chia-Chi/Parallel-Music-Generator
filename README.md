# Parallel-Music-Generator
Final Project Proposal For NYCU Parallel Programming Spring 2021

TODO:
1. Time analysis for different computation complexity, comparing notes prediction by one previous note or two previous notes
2. Time analysis for blocking and non-blocking version
3. Time analysis for pageable memory allocation & pinned memory allocation
4. Time analysis for different problem size (Try to reduce and increase lines of Major_Notes.txt & Minor_Notes.txt)
5. Time analysis for different buffer length
6. Python backend for music generation based on matrices trained
